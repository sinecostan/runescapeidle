Level 1: items. the object
Level 2: category. Includes the following:
	currency: anything in runescape (coins, tokkul) used as a currency.
	mining: will include anything gathered directly by mining (incl. rune essence), and pickaxes
	fishing: all raw fish, equipment, bait, feathers
	woodcutting: all logs and hatchets
	hunter: tools used for hunting and drops from the creatures
	divination: divine energy and signs of the porter, and portents of restoration
	smithing: all bars (note: gear will be handled separately) (note2: arrowheads, unfletched bolts go to fletching)
	cooking: cooked fish. later on I'll add baking (bread, pies etc.)
	runecrafting: talismans here. (this may be an unnecessary category - evaluate w/ rc skill)
	fletching: bowstrings, unstrung bows, crossbow limbs+stocks, unfinished arrow parts
	herblore: herbs and potions. seconds when not in other use.
	magic: runes, staves, and magic equipment (note: will include enchanted jewellery)
	melee: melee equipment, weapons
	ranged: ranged equipment, weapons
	summoning: pouches, shards, and thirds that don't fall in another category
	crafting: leather, pottery, flax, jewellery,
	farming: all seeds, compost. most farming tools will be ignored since seeds are expendable
	construction: planks and flatpack furniture, construction supplies
	quest: items used for quests and nothing else.
	misc: catch-all for other items until I need to define a new category.
			note: most items dropped uniquely from monsters will fall in to one of these categories.
Level 3: subcategories
	for example under mining, we'd use ores, pickaxes
	under woodcutting, we'd use logs, hatchets
	pickaxes/hatchets are in mining/woodcutting because they are used by those skills, even though
	smithing produces them. I am more likely to structure a loop where the item is used, as production
	will be a specific player choice, but use can be automated (e.g. if a hatchet breaks, use the next unbroken one)
Level 4: individual items
	e.g. 'copper_ore'
Level 5: properties

All items should have
Name
ID (for g/e purposes – if price is -1, item is not tradeable)
GE price
shop price (if price is -1, item can not be purchased at a shop)
High alch price
Then various properties based on the type (damage, accuracy etc.)
